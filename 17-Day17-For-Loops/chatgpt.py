#Write a program to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers.
N = int(input("enter any number: "))
sum = 1
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum +=i
    print(sum)
#find factorial of a given number

number = int(input("enter a number: "))
result = 1
for i in range(1, number+1):
  result *=i
  print(result)

Sure! Here are some practice questions involving for loops:

Sum of Natural Numbers:
Write a program to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers.

python
Copy code
# Example: n = 10, output should be 55
Print Multiplication Table:
Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number.

python
Copy code
# Example: n = 5
# Output:
# 5 x 1 = 5
# 5 x 2 = 10
# 5 x 3 = 15
# ...
# 5 x 10 = 50
Find Maximum in a List:
Write a program to find the maximum value in a list of numbers.

python
Copy code
# Example: numbers = [3, 5, 2, 8, 1]
# Output: 8
Count Vowels in a String:
Write a program to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.

python
Copy code
# Example: string = "hello world"
# Output: 3
Reverse a String:
Write a program to reverse a given string.

python
Copy code
# Example: string = "hello"
# Output: "olleh"
Calculate the Sum of Digits:
Write a program to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number.

python
Copy code
# Example: number = 12345
# Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
Fibonacci Series:
Write a program to print the first n terms of the Fibonacci series.

python
Copy code
# Example: n = 5
# Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
Factorial Using a Loop:
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop (as discussed).

python
Copy code
# Example: n = 6
# Output: 720
Check Prime Number:
Write a program to check if a given number is a prime number.

python
Copy code
# Example: number = 7
# Output: True (since 7 is a prime number)
Print Patterns:
Write a program to print a pattern like a right-angled triangle of stars.

python
Copy code
# Example: n = 5
# Output:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
These questions will help you practice and understand the use of for loops in various scenarios.
